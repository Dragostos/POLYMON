# POLYMON
A game inspired by pokemon

Originally created for the AP CSP Create Task, I started making it more than that. Well, originally I had thought I could finish it by the time it was due, but then it was time to submit and I hadn't even finished damage. So that went down the drain. I cut the damage and stuck with just the roaming aspect and then added a few final touches and boom, you have what is in create_task.py.
